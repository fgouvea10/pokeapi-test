# Bee Engineering - Pokemon API Challenge
This is a code challenge proposed by Bee Engineering. The intention was to consume the pokeapi api.
This project is using React with Vite.
Pokeapi is a RESTFUL API.

## Technologies used:
- Node.js (v13)
- React (v18)
- Vite (v3)
- Typescript (v4)
- Axios (v1.1.3)
- TailwindCSS (v3.2.1)

## Requirements
You must have Node.js installed on your machine to run this application.

## Run locally

Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fgouvea10/pokeapi-test.git
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd pokeapi-test
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
  npm i
```

Run
```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Functional requirements:
[x] The user should be able to see a main screen with a list of all Pokémons (with
corresponding name and image for each of them).<br />
[x] In the main page: apply pagination in the list of Pokémons.<br />
[x] From the main page, while clicking a Pokémon, the user should be able to navigate to
another page containing the details of that Pokémon.<br />
[x] In the Pokémon details page, the user should see at least 6 descriptions, the image and
the name of one Pokémon.<br />
[x] In the Pokémon detail page, the user should be able to favorite the Pokémon.<br />
[x] From the main page, the user should be able to navigate to another page. This page
should contain a list of the favorite Pokémons (with corresponding name and image for each
of them).<br />

## Technical requirements:
[x] The application should be implemented in React.<br />
[x] To get the list of Pókemons and their details, use the PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ (see
documentation for more details).<br />
[x] Usage of the local storage to handle the list of favorite Pokémons.<br />
[x] Usage of any UI framework adapted to React (Examples: Bootstrap, Semantic UI).<br />
[x] The app should be responsive (adapt UI so it can be displayed in different screen sizes).<br />
[x] The code should contain comments.<br />
[x] The application code should be submitted in GitHub.<br />
[x] On the README file of GitHub, should be mentioned the following information: small
description of the application, functional and technical requirements accomplished,
technologies used, and the steps of installation.<br />
Plus:
[x] Feel free to apply any UI for all the components.<br />
[x] Feel free to add any extra libraries / frameworks / dependencies.<br />
[x] In React: usage of hooks, state management, router.<br />
[] Unit tests in functions and components.<br />
